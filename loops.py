# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

people = ['Brandon', 'Alphonse', 'John', 'Mary']

#Simple 'for' loop

for person in people:
    print(f'current person: {person}')
    


# While loops execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
